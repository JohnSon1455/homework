This the base implementation of the mini project you are going to start with. It is a simple task manager web app. It contains several buckets and each bucket contains one or many different tasks.

Here are the objectives of the mini project:

1. Add user authentication to it. User will be required to sign up and then sign in to the web app with a username (email) and password
2. Build RSpec for all models and controllers with the newly added user authentication
