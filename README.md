This the base implementation of the mini project you are going to start with. It is a simple task manager web app. It contains several buckets and each bucket contains one or many different tasks.

Here are the objectives of the mini project:

1. Add user authentication to it. User will be required to sign up and then sign in to the web app with a username (email) and password
2. Add owner attributes to Bucket and Task. Owner is the user who creates the bucket and task. Owner cannot be changed after Bucket and Task are created. It must be protected in model. Show owner info (email) in bucket and task detail page.
3. Build RSpec for all models and controllers with the newly added user authentication
